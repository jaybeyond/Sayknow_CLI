# Contributing to Sayknow-CLI

Thanks for contributing. This guide is intentionally short so pull requests land on the right branch with enough context to review.

## Branch policy

Open pull requests against `dev`.

Do not target `main` unless a maintainer explicitly asks you to. `main` is reserved for maintainer-directed release flow, so PRs opened against `main` may be closed and asked to reopen against `dev`.

## Local setup

This repository uses Bun workspaces.

```sh
bun install
bun run dev:doctor
```

To run Sayknow-CLI from the checkout:

```sh
bun run dev
```

## Focused tests

Run the smallest command that covers your change before opening a PR. Common options are:

```sh
bun test path/to/file.test.ts
bun run check:tools
bun run check
```

Use focused tests first for code changes, then broader checks when the change affects shared behavior or release-critical paths.

## PR checklist

- Target branch is `dev`, not `main`.
- The PR description explains what changed and why.
- Relevant focused tests or checks are listed in the PR description.
- User-facing changes include a changelog entry when appropriate.
